## Overview

The **Stardate Calculator** is a web-based tool that allows users to calculate the stardate for any given date. The project is inspired by the stardate system used in the Star Trek universe, and it provides a user-friendly interface with a Star Trek theme.

This project is a static website that calculates the stardate using JavaScript and is hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Features

- **Date Picker**: Users can select any date using a date input field.
- **Stardate Calculation**: The stardate is calculated based on the selected date and displayed to the user.
- **Star Trek Theme**: The website features a Star Trek-inspired design, including a logo and color scheme.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/stardate-calculator.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd stardate-calculator
    ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the Stardate Calculator.

## How It Works

The stardate is calculated using a simple JavaScript function based on the following logic:

1. **Base Year**: The calculation assumes the year 2000 as the base year with a starting stardate of `10000.0`.
2. **Year Difference**: The difference in years from the base year is used to adjust the stardate.
3. **Day of the Year**: The selected date's day of the year is used to calculate the fractional part of the stardate.
